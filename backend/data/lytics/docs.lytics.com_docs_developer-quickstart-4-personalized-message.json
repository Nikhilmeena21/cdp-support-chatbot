Before we jump into the weeds of how you can fully build and leverage this profile, let's create our first experience.\nSurface a Simple Message\nLytics comes with our Personalization SDK called Pathfora. Pathfora allows you to easily surface simple lead capture and messaging modals or content directly inline. Full\ndocumentation\nfor Pathfora is available, but initially, let's surface a welcome message to our\nanonymous visitor\naudience.\njavascript\n// jstag profiles a helper function to ensure that the Pathfora library\n// has been loaded before triggering the experience.\njstag.on('pathfora.publish.done', function(topic, event){\n  // here we initialize a new Pathfora \"Message\" experience\n  var module = new pathfora.Message({\n    id: 'sample-message-campaign', // this value will be collected along side all interactions and used in reporting\n    layout: 'slideout', // for layout we'll use a small slide out\n    position: 'bottom-left', // the model will enter and sit at the bottom left\n    theme: 'dark', // css can be customized to brand but we'll use the default dark theme\n    headline: 'Hello world!', // this will be the headline of our message\n    msg: 'Congratulations on setting up your first targetted campaign using the Lytics Personalization Engine!', // the body of the message\n  });\n\n  var modules = {\n    target: [{\n      segment: \"anonymous_profiles\", // target only visitors with the anonymous_profile attribute\n      widgets: [module]\n    }]\n  };\n\n  pathfora.initializeWidgets(modules); // initialize the campaign\n});\nAlter the Pathfora configuration to your liking.\nInstall the Pathfora configuration onto your site via your preferred tag management method.\nRefresh the page and be greeted with your new welcome message targeted at anonymous visitors!\nLytics and Pathfora provide a great deal of flexibility.
