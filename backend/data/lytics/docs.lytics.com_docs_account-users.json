It doubles as an ID card and a stats card.\nYou can edit your name and email address. Both fields are required. A phone number is only required for 2FA.\nClick the \"Change Password\" button to change your password.\nResetting Passwords\nThe password must be reset by the user whose password is being reset.\nPasswords cannot be reset on behalf of others\n.\nTo reset your password, go to\nManage My Profile\nin the account menu and click the\nChange Password\nbutton.\nA modal will open, prompting for a new password can be entered.\nðŸš§\nChanging a password will immediately invalidate all current sessions across all machines for the user.\nManaging Account Users\nClick \"Manage Users\" in the account menu to manage account users.\nModifying User Permissions\nUser roles define the amount of access and permissions a Lytics user has when logged in and through the\nLytics APIs\n.\nA user may have any number of these roles, and the permissions for multiple roles are additive. For example, a user with the Campaign Manager and Content Manager roles will have access to all permissions granted by both roles.\nUsers with the Admin role can control other users' roles within your organization via the \"Manage Users\" option from the account dropdown menu.\nManaging Personally Identifiable Information\nYou can indicate any user fields in your account that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) via the private fields account setting. These fields will be hidden for anyone who does not have Admin, Data Manager, or User Search roles. You should verify with\nLytics Support\nthat the field hiding in the segment scan is also enabled for your account to ensure these fields are hidden there.\nWhat does a user of each role have access to?\nA user's role determines which parts of the Lytics app they can access.

Here is a breakdown of the permissions for each role by feature.\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII)\nTo shield PI from users who should not have access, you will need to use the private fields account setting to mark the profile fields you want to hide from anyone who does not have Admin, Data Manager, or User Search roles.\nAdmin\nAudience Manager\nCampaign Manager\nContent Manager\nData Manager\nDiscovery Insights\nExperience Manager\nGoal Manager\nMarketer\nObserver\nUser Search\nView\nx\nx\nx\nAudiences (without PII)\nAdmin\nAudience Manager\nCampaign Manager\nContent Manager\nData Manager\nDiscovery Insights\nExperience Manager\nGoal Manager\nMarketer\nObserver\nUser Search\nView\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nCreate\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nEdit\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nDuplicate\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nDelete\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nContent Topics\nAdmin\nAudience Manager\nCampaign Manager\nContent Manager\nData Manager\nDiscovery Insights\nExperience Manager\nGoal Manager\nMarketer\nObserver\nUser Search\nBlocklist\nx\nx\nContent Collections\nAdmin\nAudience Manager\nCampaign Manager\nContent Manager\nData Manager\nDiscovery Insights\nExperience Manager\nGoal Manager\nMarketer\nObserver\nUser Search\nView\nx\nx\nx\nx\nCreate\nx\nx\nx\nEdit\nx\nx\nx\nDuplicate\nx\nx\nx\nDelete\nx\nx\nAuthorizations (for imports & exports)\nAdmin\nAudience Manager\nCampaign Manager\nContent Manager\nData Manager\nDiscovery Insights\nExperience Manager\nGoal Manager\nMarketer\nObserver\nUser Search\nView\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nCreate\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nEdit\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nDelete\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nJobs (imports & exports)\nThe former \"Integrations\" tab is now comprised of the \"Jobs\" and \"Authorizations\" sections, which allow you to manage your import and exports.\nAdmin\nAudience Manager\nCampaign Manager\nContent Manager\nData Manager\nDiscovery Insights\nExperience Manager\nGoal Manager\nMarketer\nObserver\nUser Search\nView\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nCreate\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nPause\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nUpdate\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nDelete\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nAccounts & Users\nAdmin\nAudience Manager\nCampaign Manager\nContent Manager\nData Manager\nDiscovery Insights\nExperience Manager\nGoal Manager\nMarketer\nObserver\nUser Search\nInvite User\nx\nManage User Roles\nx\nCreate Account\nx\nEdit Account\nx\nView Account Usage\nx\nPersonalize Campaigns\nAdmin\nAudience Manager\nCampaign Manager\nContent Manager\nData Manager\nDiscovery Insights\nExperience Manager\nGoal Manager\nMarketer\nObserver\nUser Search\nView\nx\nx\nx\nx\nCreate\nx\nx\nx\nEdit\nx\nx\nx\nDuplicate\nx\nx\nx\nDelete\nx\nx\nAdditional API-Only Features\nAll roles have API read access to topic rollups, segment collections, and SegmentML.
