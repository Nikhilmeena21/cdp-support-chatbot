You can then export Lytics audiences back to Acoustic to refine your targeting and deliver personalized messaging.\nAuthorization\nIf you have not done so already, you will need to set up an Acoustic account before you begin the process described below. Your Acoustic account user must have permission to create\nApplication Access\nvia the API.\nSelect\nAcoustic\nfrom the list of providers.\nSelect the\nFull Auth\nmethod for authorization.\nEnter a\nLabel\nto identify your authorization.\n(Optional) Enter a\nDescription\nfor further context on your authorization.\nEnter your\nClient ID\nfor the application that you have created in your Acoustic account. For more information, please refer to\nAcoustic Documentation\n.\nEnter the\nClient Secret\nfor your entered Client ID.\nEnter the\nPod\nnumber of your Acoustic Campaign. You can find the Pod information in Account Setting page of your\nAcoustic\naccount. For example, if it is\nPod 2\nthen just enter\n2\n.\nEnter\nRefresh Token\nthat you have created to grant Lytics access. For more information, please refer to\nAcoustic Documentation\n.\nEnter your\nSFTP Username\nfor the Acoustic Account.\nEnter your\nSFTP Password\nfor the above SFTP User. You can use your own credentials here, or create a new user for this integration.\nClick\nSave Authorization\n.\nðŸ“˜\nFor this integration, it is recommended to create a new Acoustic User specific for Lytics with the option\nDo not enforce password expiration policies for this user\nselected so the authentication is long lasting, and can be revoked on an account by account basis.\nImport Audiences & Activity\nImport Acoustic users and their activity information into Lytics so you can leverage that data to build behavioral audiences and gain Insights powered by Lytics data science.\nIntegration Details\nImplementation Type\n:\nServer-side Integration\n.\nImplementation Technique\n: XML\nAPI Integration\nto download CSV formatted data.\nFrequency\n:  Data is imported as a\nBatch Integration\n; imported once, or every 8 hours on a continuous basis.\nResulting Data\n: Full Lytics user profiles for all Acoustic users complete with activity data.\nThis integration utilizes the\nAcoustic XML API\nto import Acoustic users and their activity to Lytics. Each run of the job will proceed as follows:\nExports\nusers from the selected Acoustic Database as a CSV file to an Acoustic-manged SFTP server. The CSV files are then read and imported to the\nsilverpop_users\nstream in Lytics.\nExports\nemail activity from users in the selected Acoustic Database as a CSV file to an Acoustic-manged SFTP server. The CSV files are then read and imported to the\nsilverpop_activity\nstream in Lytics.\nAfter successful completion, the job will import new/updated users with their updated activity every 8 hours if\nconfigured\nto run continuously.\nFields\nThe following fields are included in the default mapping for the\nsilverpop_users\nstream. Note this integration was formerly named Silverpop, hence the data stream name, but this job will receive your current Acoustic data.\nSource Field\nLytics User Field\nDescription\nType\nemail\nemail\nunique_id\nEmail Address\nstring\nFirst Name\nfirst_name\nFirst Name\nstring\nLast Name\nlast_name\nLast Name\nstring\nEmail Type\nsp_email_type\nAcoustic Email Type\nstring\nmap(list,\nOpted Out\n)\nsp_list_optout_status\nAcoustic Optout Status by List\nmap[string]string\nmap(list, todate(\nOpted Out Date\n))\nsp_list_opt_out_date\nAcoustic Opt Out Date by List\nmap[string]time\nmap(list, todate(\nOpt In Date\n))\nsp_list_opt_in_date\nAcoustic Opt In Date by List\nmap[string]time\nmap(list,\nOpt In Details\n)\nsp_list_opt_in_details\nAcoustic Opt In Details\nmap[string]string\nemaildomain(email)\nemaildomain\nEmail Domain\nstring\nSimilarly, the following fields are included in the default mapping for the\nsilverpop_activity\nstream:\nSource Field\nLytics User Field\nDescription\nType\nEmail\nemail\nunique id\nstring\nemail\nemaildomain\nEmail Domain\nstring\nUrl\nhashedurls\nHashed Urls Visited\nmap[string]intsum\nmax(\nepochms()\n)\nlast_active_ts\nLast Active on Any Channel\ndate\nCampaign Id\nsv_campaign_ids\nAcoustic Campaign the send originated from\n[]string\nevent\nsv_clickct\nAcoustic Click count\nint\nEvent Type\nsv_email_event\nAcoustic Events\nmap[string]intsum\nUrl\nsv_email_urls\nAcoustic URLs\n[]string\nmin(\nepochms()\n)\nsv_firstclick_ts\nAcoustic First Click\ndate\nmin(\nepochms()\n)\nsv_firstopen_ts\nAcoustic First Open\ndate\nmin(\nepochms()\n)\nsv_firstsent_ts\nAcoustic First Sent\nnumber\nhourofday()\nsv_hourlyopen\nAcoustic Hourly Events\nmap[string]intsum\nhourofweek()\nsv_hourofweek\nAcoustic Hour of Week Events\nmap[string]intsum\nmax(\nepochms()\n)\nsv_lastclick_ts\nAcoustic Last Click\ndate\nmax(\nepochms()\n)\nsv_lastopen_ts\nAcoustic Last Open\ndate\nmax(\nepochms()\n)\nsv_lastsent_ts\nAcoustic Last Sent\ndate\nlist_id\nsv_list_ids\nAcoustic List the send originated from\n[]string\nMailing Id\nsv_mailing_ids\nAcoustic Mailing the send originated from\n[]string\nMailing Name\nsv_mailing_names\nAcoustic Mailing Names\n[]string\nMailing Name\nsv_mailing_names_click_count\nAcoustic Mailing Names Click Count\nmap[string]intsum\nMailing Name\nsv_mailing_names_clicked\nAcoustic Mailing Names Clicked\n[]string\nMailing Name\nsv_mailing_names_open_count\nAcoustic Mailing Names Open Count\nmap[string]intsum\nMailing Name\nsv_mailing_names_opened\nAcoustic Mailing Names Opened\n[]string\nMailing Name\nsv_mailing_names_sent\nAcoustic Mailing Names Sent\n[]string\nMailing Name\nsv_mailing_names_sent_count\nAcoustic Mailing Name Sent Count\nmap[string]intsum\nyymm()\nsv_monthly\nAcoustic Opens By Month\nmap[string]intsum\nevent\nsv_openct\nAcoustic Open count\nint\nProgram Id\nsv_program_ids\nAcoustic Program Ids\n[]string\nmin(\nepochms()\n)\nsv_subscribe_ts\nAcoustic Subscribe Time\ndate\nmin(\nepochms()\n)\nsv_unsubscribe_ts\nAcoustic Unsubscribe Time\ndate\nConfiguration\nFollow these steps to set up an Import Audiences and Activity Data job for Acoustic.\nSelect\nAcoustic\nfrom the list of providers.\nSelect the\nImport Audiences and Activity Data\njob type from the list.\nSelect the Authorization you would like to use or\ncreate a new one\n.\nEnter a\nLabel\nto identify this job you are creating in Lytics.\n(Optional) Enter a\nDescription\nfor further context on your job.\nFrom the\nType\ndropdown, select the Acoustic source type: database, list, or query.\nFrom the\nSource\ndropdown, select the Acoustic source to import user data from.\nClick on the\nShow Advanced Options\ntab to expand the advanced configuration.\nCheck the\nKeep Updated\ncheckbox to update the list every 8 hours.\nIn the\nActivity Start\nfield, enter the date to import activity from.
