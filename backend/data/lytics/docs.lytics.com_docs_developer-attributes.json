Additionally, Lytics employs predictive modeling and machine learning algorithms to provide insights and scores, allowing users to gain a deeper understanding of their audience. The guide below provides an overview of all available attributes and examples to enhance your profiling efforts.\n👍\nIf you haven't already reviewed our\ndocumentation on collecting events\nvia our JavaScript SDK, we highly recommend doing so first. This will give you a better understanding of how data collection works at a high level before delving into the specifics of what can be collected.\nAvailable Attributes\nThe following attributes are all available out of the box with no customization necessary in all Lytics pricing tiers. Do note that any attributes flagged as\nComputed\ncan not be edited directly but are computed based on various factors, including other non-computed attributes.\n📘\nFor a more comprehensive example of how any of the following attributes can be collected and used for your visitors click the\nname\nof the identifier to access the code examples below.\nIdentifiers\nDefault attributes that are used to stitch profiles together. For instance, if you pass an\nemail\nalong with the\n_uid\n, all events that have only been associated with either identifier will be merged into a single comprehensive profile.\nName\nSlug\nDescription\nComputed\nExample\nLytics ID\n_id\nA unique ID that represents the materialized profile in Lytics.\nYes\n4fafb5b3-b199-58f2-a68b-4b266b363dd1\nCurrent Lytics Cookie\n_uid\nThe current cookie id for the user.\nNo\n50b772f5-a0be-42f2-8828-84b8db5d5a23\nAll Lytics Cookies\n_uids\nAll cookies that are associated with the user.\nNo\n[\"50b772f5-a0be-42f2-8828-84b8db5d5a23\"]\nEmail\nemail\nThe email address of the user.\nNo\n[email protected]\nUnique User ID\nuuid\nA UUID for the user.\nNo\n4fafb5b3-b199-58f2-a68b-4b266b363dd1\nDetails\nDetails encompass all default attributes related to user demographics and general information, including name, phone number, status, etc. It serves as a catch-all for attributes not specifically tied to interactions or behaviors.\nName\nSlug\nDescription\nComputed\nExample\nName\nname\nThe full name of the user.\nNo\nJohn Doe\nFirst Name\nfirst_name\nThe first name of the user.\nNo\nJohn\nLast Name\nlast_name\nThe last name of the user.\nNo\nDoe\nTitle\ntitle\nThe title of the user.\nNo\nPresident\nPhone\nphone\nThe phone number of the user.\nNo\n555-555-5555\nCell\ncell\nThe cell phone number of the user.\nNo\n555-555-5555\nOrigin\norigin\nThe origin of the user.\nNo\nloyalty_2022\nLanguage\nlanguage\nThe language of the user.\nNo\nen-us\nAge\nage\nThe age of the user.\nNo\n25\nCompanies\ncompanies\nThe companies the user is associated with.\nNo\n[\"Lytics\", \"Pantheon\"]\nGender\ngender\nThe gender of the user.\nNo\nM\nStatus\nstatus\nThe status of the user.\nNo\nactive\nUser Attributes\nuser_attributes\nA map of custom attributes associated with the user.\nNo\n{\"role\": \"member\", \"bonus\": \"active\"}\nTimezone\ntimezone\nThe timezone of the user.\nNo\n-7\nCity\ncity\nThe city of the user.\nNo\nDenver\nCountry\ncountry\nThe country of the user.\nNo\nUS\nState\nstate\nThe state of the user.\nNo\nCO\nMeta\nMeta encompasses all system-level information that provides insights into the health and breadth of the profile.

These insights are invaluable when personalizing experiences based on changes in behavior or behaviors indicative of high likelihood. For instance, you might want to present a premium offer to users exhibiting higher momentum than usual. Behavioral attributes enable targeted and timely interventions tailored to user actions and patterns.\nName\nSlug\nDescription\nComputed\nExample\nConsistency\nscore_consistency\nScore representing how consistent their activity patterns are.\nYes\n99\nFrequency\nscore_frequency\nA score representing how frequently the user is active.\nYes\n63\nIntensity\nscore_intensity\nA score representing how intense the user's activity is.\nYes\n94\nMaturity\nscore_maturity\nA score representing how mature the user's activity is.\nYes\n34\nMomentum\nscore_momentum\nA score representing how much momentum the user currently has.\nYes\n54\nPropensity\nscore_propensity\nA score representing how likely the user is to engage again.\nYes\n1\nQuantity\nscore_quantity\nA score representing how much activity the user has.\nYes\n99\nRecency\nscore_recency\nA score representing how recent the user's activity is.\nYes\n99\nVolatility\nscore_volatility\nA score representing the degree of variability in behavior.\nYes\n99\nInterests\nInterests entail understanding the topics a user is interested in based on their interactions, cross-referenced by deep programmatic analysis of their online activities.

Each of the behavioral attributes are surfaced as a score between 0 and 100. These scores represent an aggregate summary of the user's behavior across various dimensions: Consistency, Frequency, Intensity, Maturity, Momentum, Propensity, Quantity, Recency, and Volatility.\nInterests\nLytics Content (\nlytics_content\n)\nThe interest attributes are computed in real-time and represent the user's interest in various topics. These topics are generated as a result of the analysis done by the Lytics Interest Engine and then associated with the user based upon their interaction with content on your site.\nIntelligence\nSegment Membership (\n_segments\n)\nThis attribute displays an array of all segments the user is currently a member of. It updates in real-time based on various audience definitions. Lytics offers a range of useful segments out of the box, requiring no additional setup. For detailed information on these audiences, refer to our Developer Tier > Audiences documentation.\nSplit & Split2 (\n_split\n&\n_split2\n)\nThese attributes are automatically generated by Lytics and represent a random value evenly distributed across users. They are useful for split testing and experimentation.\nNeeds Message (\nneeds_message\n)\nThis attribute is computed in real-time and represents the relative distance between now and the next predicted event. It is stream specific and is useful for understanding when a user is likely to engage again.\nNext Event (\nnext_event\n)\nThis attribute is computed in real-time and represents the next expected event. It is stream specific and is useful for understanding when a user is likely to engage again.\nLookalike Model Predictions & Lookalike Model Percentiles (\nsegment_prediction\n&\nsegment_prediction_percentile\n)\nThis attribute is computed in real-time and represents the scores resulting from Lytics Lookalike and SegmentML models.

By default Lytics will collect a\npv\nevent for each page view and this will automatically populate the\nfirst_seen\nand\nlast_seen\nattributes. Below is an example of collecting a custom event that would populate these attributes as well.\nJavaScript\njstag.send({\n  _e:\"custom_event\"\n});```\nChannels (\nchannels\n) [needs update]\nJavaScript\njstag.send({\n  _channel:\"web\",\n});\nDevices (\ndevices\n)\nJavaScript\njstag.send({\n  _device:\"desktop\",\n});\nHourly (\nhourly\n)\nThis attribute is automatically populated with a count of events per hour for the user.\nHour of Week (\nhourofweek\n)\nThis attribute is automatically populated with a count of events per hour of the week for the user.\nLast Active Timestamp (\nlast_active_ts\n)\nThis attribute is automatically populated with the last time an event was received in any stream for the user.\nLast Channel Activities (\nlast_channel_activities\n) [needs update]\nJavaScript\njstag.send({\n  _channel:\"web\",\n});\nWeb\nDomains (\ndomains\n)\nThis attribute is automatically populated with the domains the user has been active on.\nFirst Visit Timestamp (\nfirstvisit_ts\n)\nThis attribute is automatically populated with the first time the user visited the site and sends data to the\ndefault\nstream.\nLast Visit Timestamp (\nlastvisit_ts\n)\nThis attribute is automatically populated with the last time the user visited the site and sends data to the\ndefault\nstream.\nPageview Count (\npageviewct\n)\nThis attribute is automatically populated with the number of\n_pv\nevents recieved for the user.\nJavaScript\njstag.send({\n  _e:\"pv\"\n});\nReferring Domain (\nrefdomain\n)\nThis attribute is automatically populated with the referring domain for the user.\nJavaScript\njstag.send({\n  _ref:\"umami.lytics.com\",\n});\nUser Agent (\nuser_agent\n)\nThis attribute is automatically populated based on the user agent of the browser.
